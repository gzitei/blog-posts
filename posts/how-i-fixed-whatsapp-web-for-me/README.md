# How I fixed WhatsApp Web (for me)

### The Problem

To fit all my developer tools and documentations in my screen, I like to use a tilling window tool called [Tactile](https://gitlab.com/lundal/tactile) on Ubuntu. That's where the problem starts.

Even though I'm pretty sure people at Meta must have a good reason for that, but WhatsApp Web's responsiveness leaves room for improvement.

I like to have it tilled as a little vertical bar side by side with my text editor so I can answer my girlfriend even when I am working (sorry my friends, she takes all my WhatsApp attention).
That's where responsiveness falls short. The contact's sidebar takes almost all the viewport, there is no space left for the user to interact with the conversation, as shown in [Figure 1](./images/problem.webp)
